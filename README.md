# oregon-trail-78
The immortal Oregon Trail game, ported from the 1978 BASIC version to a Swift console application.

If you are on macOS, you can download the executable and play the game. Depending on your system preferences (because it is ad hoc signed), it may run if you double-click the file. Or execute it from the Terminal command line and it will run in your Terminal tab; you may have to set the file permissions to make it executable (chmod +x).

This is a port of a computer game published in Creative Computing May-June 1978 Vol 4 No 3 pp 132 - 139 "Oregon Trail" by Dan Rawitsch,
which I found online on https://archive.org/stream/creativecomputing-1978-05/Creative_Computing_v04_n03_1978_May-June#page/n139/mode/1up.
I ported it from that BASIC code out of a fascination with the original game and a desire to get some practice with Swift.

Feedback welcome, don't get too low on food, and enjoy!
