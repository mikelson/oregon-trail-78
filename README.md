# oregon-trail-78
The immortal Oregon Trail game, ported from the 1978 BASIC version to a Swift console application.

If you are on macOS, you can download the executable and play the game. Double-click the file, or execute it from the Terminal command line and it will run in your Terminal tab.

This is a port of a computer game published in Creative Computing May-June 1978 Vol 4 No 3 pp 132 - 139 "Oregon Trail" by Dan Rawitsch,
which I found online on https://archive.org/stream/creativecomputing-1978-05/Creative_Computing_v04_n03_1978_May-June#page/n139/mode/1up.
I ported it from that BASIC code out of a fascination with the original game and a desire to get some practice with Swift.

Feedback welcome, don't get too low on food, and enjoy!
